# BCC lexer + parser strategy

## Approach: hand-written recursive descent

The lexer and parser are hand-written. We don't use a parser generator
(LALR/PEG/combinators) for the standard reasons every production C
compiler avoids them:

- C is famously context-sensitive — the canonical example being `T * x;`
  which is a declaration when `T` is a typedef-name and an expression
  statement otherwise. Resolving this requires the parser to feed
  classification back to the lexer (the "lexer hack"), which any parser
  generator must be wedged into supporting.
- Byte-exact matching of `BCC.EXE` requires preserving BCC's
  idiosyncrasies (warning text, error positions, K&R acceptance,
  declaration ordering, the *exact* source-comment interleaving in
  `-S` output). Hand-rolled code lets us wedge in BCC-specific
  behaviors at the exact site they fire.
- We grow fixture-by-fixture. Adding "return integer literal" or
  "variable declaration with initializer" is a function or two of
  hand-written code each — no DSL/grammar maintenance burden.

GCC, clang, and tcc all use hand-written recursive descent for their C
parsers. There's a reason.

## Decisions

- **Whole-unit AST today; source-order emission preserved.** The current
  implementation tokenizes, parses a full translation-unit AST, and then
  codegen walks that AST in source order. This is not a literal parser-
  drives-codegen pipeline, but it preserves the ordering that matters for
  BCC-style source comments, function labels, and symbol emission.
- **Typedef classification is parser-side today.** The first typedef
  fixtures have landed, so `Parser` now carries a typedef table and treats
  matching identifiers as type names in declaration/type contexts. There
  is not a separate lexer callback API; the lexer still produces ordinary
  identifiers and the parser classifies them where needed.
- **AST faithful to source order.** Preserve the order BCC saw the
  declarations and statements in. Preserve redundant parentheses and
  comment positions to the extent they affect output. We can normalize
  later if/when an optimizer wants it, but byte-exact reproduction of an
  ordering-sensitive compiler depends on not normalizing in front-end.

## Module layout (inside `crates/bcc/`)

```

`emit_s.rs` owns file-level scaffolding (macro preamble, segment
scaffold, globals/string tail), while `codegen/` owns function bodies and
most instruction-level BCC patterns.

## Source locations and spans

Every token carries a `Span { start: BytePos, end: BytePos }` and a
`Position { line: u32, column: u32 }` derivable from it. Every AST node
that can appear in a diagnostic carries its primary span. We need this
day one because BCC's error messages cite source positions and those
messages eventually have to match in our captured stdout/stderr (when we
care about that — currently advisory).

## Growth Model

The parser still grows fixture-by-fixture. Early fixtures covered integer
returns, local declarations, arithmetic, calls, and control flow; later
fixtures added typedefs, structs/unions, enums, static locals,
K&R-parameter declarations, casts, `sizeof`, pointers, arrays, function
pointers, and `long`/`unsigned long` spellings. The document should not be
read as a complete C grammar: implemented grammar exists only where a
fixture has forced it.

Whenever the parser refuses a construct, the verify failure should say
*why* with a clear message. That failure is the cue to capture the
smallest oracle fixture for the construct before extending the parser.

## Integer literal forms

C90 spells integer literals three ways and the lexer accepts all
three:

- `0x`/`0X` prefix → hex (`0xFF`, `0X1234`).
- Bare leading `0` followed by an octal digit → octal (`0755` is 493,
  *not* 755 — verified by fixture `445` whose oracle bytes encode
  0x01ED).
- Otherwise → decimal.

A lone `0` is decimal zero — the octal check requires a trailing
`0..=7` digit. Suffixes `L`/`l`/`U`/`u` and combinations are accepted
and discarded as before; the surrounding type context decides the
ultimate width. Fixtures `443`–`445` round-trip hex assignment, hex
mask via compound-assign, and an octal literal respectively.

Hex/octal and decimal codegen are *equivalent at the byte level* —
`s.x &= 0xFF` and `s.x &= 255` produce identical OBJs (this was
empirically verified during fixture `390`'s capture). So adding the
lexer support didn't require any codegen changes; the literal value
flows through `IntLit(u32)` regardless of source form.

`IntLit(u32)` holds 32 bits and is wide enough for any long-sized
hex literal that's actually used in BC2 corpus. The literal's
target type is decided later by context, so a `long g = 0x12345678;`
splits across two `mov` halves the usual way (fixture `446`), and
the `L` suffix on `0xFFL` is accepted and discarded — context
already knew the target was long (fixture `447`). A long-typed
compound-assign with a hex mask (`g &= 0xFFFF;`) routes through the
same `emit_long_compound_to_mem` skeleton as any other long-with-
constant compound (fixture `448`); the hex form is purely
front-end.

## Character literals

Character constants (`'A'`, `'\n'`, `'\xFF'`) lex into
`IntLit(u32)` — C90 says character constants have type `int`, so
there's no separate `CharLit` token. The single-byte value flows
through the same paths as any other int-typed constant.

Escape sequences are shared with string literals via a single
`decode_escape` helper: `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\0`, `\\`, `\'`, `\"`,
`\a` (0x07), `\b` (0x08), `\f` (0x0C), `\v` (0x0B), and `\xH...`
(one-or-more hex digits, *greedily consumed*, taken mod 256).
Octal escapes (`\NNN`) and multi-byte character constants (`'ab'`)
await fixtures.

BCC's `\x` is greedy and errors with "Numeric constant too large"
when the cumulative value exceeds 0xFF — e.g. `"\x7Fb"` is parsed
as `\x7Fb` (0x7FB), not `\x7F` + `b`. Our lexer matches the
greedy parsing but silently masks to 0xFF rather than erroring;
fixtures using `\x` must keep the value in range and either end
the string immediately or follow with a non-hex character (fixture
`455` uses `"\x41"`).

Fixtures `449`–`451` cover printable ASCII (`'A'` → 65), the
common-case named escape (`'\n'` → 10), and a hex escape at the
upper end of the byte range (`'\xFF'` → 255). All three round-trip
to identical bytes vs. the equivalent decimal forms. Fixtures
`455`–`457` cover string escapes (`"\x41"`, `"\b"`, `"\f"`) — the
shared `decode_escape` works equally well in either literal form.

The store side picked up an assembler-level gap: `mov byte ptr
DGROUP:_<g>, K` (encoded `C6 06 disp16 ii`) wasn't supported. Added
as `Instr::MovGroupSymImm8`, parallel to the existing word-form
`Instr::MovGroupSymImm16` (`C7 06 ...`). The codegen side already
emitted the right asm text for char-typed globals; only the
assembler needed to learn the form.

Constant char arithmetic (`'Z' - 'A'`) folds at compile time the same
way any int-constant arithmetic does, so a char-literal pair
collapses to a single `mov word ptr DGROUP:_g, 25` (fixture `453`,
no register touched).

The compare side has an analogous byte-form: `cmp byte ptr
DGROUP:_<c>, K` (encoded `80 3E disp16 ii`), distinct from the
word-form `cmp word ptr DGROUP:_<g>, K` (`83 3E ...` / `81 3E ...`).
BCC picks the byte form when the *left* operand is a char-typed
global — even when the source-side compares against an int-promoted
char literal like `if (c == 'A')`. Added as
`Instr::CmpByteGroupSymImm8` and emitted by `emit_compare` for the
char-global branch (fixture `452`).

`switch (g)` against a global int scrutinee loads via the moffs16
short form `mov ax, word ptr DGROUP:_g` (`A1 disp16`), the same
load shape as any other int-global value-load — no special path.
Verified with character-literal case labels (fixture `454`); the
chained-compare dispatch then uses ordinary int constants since
case labels are int-typed.

## `unsigned char`

`unsigned char` is a separate type variant (`Type::UChar`) from
`char`. Storage and assignment are byte-identical to `char` —
size 1, alignment 1, same `mov byte ptr DGROUP:_c, K` encoding for
constant assignment (fixture `458`). The two diverge only on:

1. **Comparison.** Unsigned-jump mnemonic family — `jbe/jb/ja/jae`
   instead of `jle/jl/jg/jge`. `Type::is_unsigned()` includes
   `UChar`, so the existing signedness-driven jump-selection path
   picks the right mnemonic automatically. Fixture `459`:
   `if (c > 200)` becomes `cmp byte ptr [_c], 200 / jbe …`.
2. **Int promotion.** Zero-extend via `mov ah, 0` (`B4 00`, 2 bytes)
   instead of sign-extend via `cbw` (`98`, 1 byte). Driven by
   `gty.is_unsigned()` at the load site. Fixture `460`:
   `g = c + 1` becomes `mov al, [_c] / mov ah, 0 / inc ax /
   mov [_g], ax`.

Since storage is shared, almost every `matches!(<t>, Type::Char)`
site in the codegen was a storage-width check (`byte` vs. `word`).
Those were converted en masse to `<t>.is_char_like()` which returns
true for both `Char` and `UChar`. Sign-extension sites stayed
explicit and consult `is_unsigned()` to pick between `cbw` and
`mov ah, 0`.

Parser: the top-level type-probe and `parse_type` both learned the
`unsigned char` sequence. `unsigned` followed by `char` consumes
both tokens and yields `Type::UChar`; the existing post-`unsigned`
`int`-consumption stays intact for the `unsigned int` and bare
`unsigned` forms.

### Coverage in locals, struct fields, arrays

Fixtures `461`–`463` extend uchar to stack-local, struct-field, and
array contexts. The codegen now factors the widening choice into a
single `emit_widen_al(&ty)` helper — applied at every char-load
site (`mov al, byte ptr <addr>` followed by widening). Each site
threads through the leaf type (`leaf_ty`, `pointee`, `field_ty`)
so signed `char` keeps `cbw` and `unsigned char` picks
`mov ah, 0`. The local-assign path also gained a char-aware
immediate-store shape: `mov byte ptr [bp-N], K` (`C6 46 ii ii`, 4
bytes) instead of the previously-unconditional `mov word ptr
[bp-N], K` (`C7 46 ii ww ww`, 5 bytes) for stack-resident char
locals.

### Struct sizing — raw vs. rounded

Fixture `462` (`struct { unsigned char b; int x; }` in `_BSS`)
pinned an unobserved corner: **BCC's struct intrinsic size is the
raw field-sum, with no end-padding to a word boundary**. `_s`
emits 3 bytes of BSS storage, not 4. The earlier "round size up to
even" rule in `parse_record_type` was wrong — it conflated
intrinsic size with local-frame allocation size. Removed the round
for structs (kept for unions until a fixture pins their behavior).

To preserve fixture `102`'s `[bp-4],9` / `[bp-3],42` layout, the
*local frame allocator* now rounds each slot's size up to the
type's alignment before adding it to the running `stack_bytes`
cursor. So a 3-byte struct with alignment 2 occupies a 4-byte
slot, with the struct base at the low (aligned) address and
field offsets layered on top. The previous code already aligned
the *start* of each slot to the type's alignment; rounding the
size up to alignment as well closes the gap.

### `unsigned char` as param / pointee / return

Fixtures `464`–`466` extend uchar to function param, pointer
target, and return type. Two more latent gaps surfaced:

1. **Byte-store through a pointer register** wasn't supported in
   the assembler — `mov byte ptr [si], imm8` (`C6 04 ii`, 3
   bytes). Added as `Instr::MovSiPtrImm8`, paralleling the existing
   word-form `MovSiPtrImm` (`C7 04 ww ww`). Fixture 465 uses it
   for `*p = 200;` where `p: unsigned char *` in SI.
2. **Return value widening differs by signedness**: signed `char`
   return emits `cbw` after the AL load (fixture 156); unsigned
   `char` return emits *no widening* — the value lives in AL alone
   and the upper byte is left undefined. Fixture 466 pins the
   uchar shape: `mov al, byte ptr DGROUP:_g / jmp short epilogue
   / ret`, no `mov ah, 0`. `emit_return_value_load` now
   short-circuits the uchar-ident case to emit just the byte load.

### BSS layout — short bucket first

Fixture `465` (uchar array + int global) exposed that BCC's _BSS
member ordering is **not** pure alphabetical. The actual rule:
*short-named globals (mangled `_<name>` length < 3) in alphabetical
order first, then long-named globals in alphabetical order*. This
is the same length-bucket discriminant the publics emission uses,
applied to globals (and effectively the reverse of the publics
emission order, filtered to BSS members).

The earlier "alphabetical" reading happened to coincide on
fixtures 181/234/462 because their names all fell in the same
bucket. 465 has `_buf` (4 chars including underscore) in the long
bucket and `_g` (2 chars) in the short bucket, so the buckets
diverge: oracle emits `_g, _buf` (short → long) with no padding,
not the alphabetical `_buf, _g` that would require a 1-byte pad
to align `_g`.

### Publics emission — long bucket direction

The long bucket's sort direction depends on whether the source
has either a short-named global *or* a long-named **initialized**
global (one that lands in `_DATA`). Fixture `498`
(`char msg[16] = "hello"; int main { return 0; }`) forced the
latest refinement: even with no short global, a `_DATA`-resident
long global flips the order to forward. The current rule:

- If the long bucket contains a global **and** the source has at
  least one short-named global, **or** the source has at least one
  long-named global with an initializer (in `_DATA`): emit the
  long bucket in **forward** alphabetical order (globals,
  functions, helpers mixed together).
- Otherwise: emit in **reverse** alphabetical order.

Pinning fixtures:

- 095 (`_sum`, `_main`) — no short global, no DATA global →
  reverse → `_sum, _main`.
- 179 (`_add`, `_main`) — same → reverse → `_main, _add`.
- 260 (`_main`, `N_LXMUL@`) — short globals `_a, _b` present, but
  long bucket has no global → reverse → `_main, N_LXMUL@`.
- 465 (`_buf`, `_main`) — long global + short global `_g` →
  forward → `_buf, _main`.
- 491 (`_pts`, `_main`) — long global + short global `_g` →
  forward → `_main, _pts`.
- 494 (`_head`, `_main`) — long BSS global only, no short global,
  no DATA global → reverse → `_main, _head`.
- 498 (`_msg`, `_main`) — long DATA global (`msg[16] = "hello"`)
  → forward → `_main, _msg`.

Fixture `506` (`int helper(int); int main { return helper(7); }
int helper(int x) { ... }`) adds a third trigger: a function
prototype (`body: None` followed later by a matching definition)
flips the order to forward. Updated rule:

- If `(long has global AND short has global)` OR `long has an
  initialized DATA global` OR `there is any function prototype`,
  use **forward** alphabetical for the long bucket.
- Otherwise use **reverse**.

Pinning fixture: 506 → forward → `_helper, _main`.

The intuition is that BCC's internal iteration order is sensitive
to which symbol table buckets are non-empty: initialized-data
globals, short-named globals, and seen-twice symbols (prototype +
def) all leave a record that flips a "forward iteration" mode for
the long bucket. The exact mechanism remains unclear; further
fixtures may force more refinement.

## `signed` keyword

`signed`, `signed char`, `signed int`, `signed long [int]`,
`long signed [int]` are all accepted by `parse_type` and lower to
the corresponding signed types (`Type::Int`, `Type::Char`,
`Type::Long`). Codegen is identical to the unprefixed forms
since BCC's plain `char`/`int`/`long` are already signed. Fixtures
`467` (`signed char`) and `468` (`signed int`) round-trip to the
same bytes as the unprefixed equivalents — the keyword is purely
front-end.

## `enum <tag>` as a type

In addition to anonymous `enum { A, B, C };` (which only registers
the member constants), `enum <tag>` can now also be used as a type
name in declarations. Fixtures `470`–`472` exercise this as a
global type, local type, and function-parameter type respectively.

Codegen: `enum <tag>` lowers to `Type::Int` (BCC sizes enums as
int). No special storage, comparison, or widening — purely a
front-end alias.

Parser:
- The standalone `enum [<tag>] { … };` dispatcher in `parse_unit`
  now only fires when an opening `{` follows the (optional) tag.
  When the form is `enum <tag> <decl>` the dispatcher skips and the
  type-prefix path handles it.
- `parse_type` learned `enum [<tag>]` → `Type::Int` (the tag is
  consumed if present but we don't require it to be in any tag
  table — the enum members were registered at the definition site).
- The top-level type-probe gained an `enum [<tag>]` arm.
- `parse_stmt`'s declaration dispatch now accepts `KwEnum` (and
  `KwSigned`, completing the set started in batch 50) as a type
  start, so `enum color c;` works inside function bodies.

Explicit member values (`enum flag { OFF = 0, ON = 1, AUTO = 7 }`)
also flow through the same path — the body parser already accepted
`= <int-lit>` per-member, and the values fold into `IntLit` at use
sites (fixture `473`).

The body form `enum [<tag>] { … } <decl>` (combined definition +
declaration) works too. Fixture `474`'s
`enum { A = 1, B = 2, C = 3 } x;` declares both the constants and
a local `x`. Implementation factored `parse_enum_body` out of
`parse_enum_decl` so `parse_type`'s enum branch can reuse it; the
caller consumes through `}`, then the surrounding declare path
sees the declarator.

## `const` / `volatile` / `register` qualifiers

`const`, `volatile`, and `register` are accepted as discardable
qualifiers — BCC keeps the storage layout identical to the
unqualified form. Fixtures `475` (const global), `476` (volatile
global), and `477` (register local) all round-trip to bytes that
match the equivalent unqualified declaration.

Implementation: a single `while` loop at the top of `parse_type`
consumes any combination of these three keywords, and a parallel
consumer runs at the start of the top-level type-probe. All three
are also accepted as type-starts in `parse_stmt`'s declaration
dispatch. No AST node — the qualifiers are just dropped.

Note: BCC's actual `register` keyword is a *hint* that forces
enregistration even below the natural use-count threshold (the
oracle for `register int x; x = 5; g = x;` enregisters `x` into
SI even though `x` only has 2 uses, below the int-enregistration
threshold of 3). We don't yet honor that hint — fixture `477` uses
`x` three times so it enregisters naturally; if a real fixture
requires register-hint enregistration the allocator will need a
new bias channel.

### Register-resident int → global store

While unblocking fixture `477` a separate gap turned up: `g = x`
where `x` is a register-resident int local was emitted as
`mov ax, si / mov word ptr [_g], ax` (5 bytes, AX round-trip).
BCC emits the direct `mov word ptr [_g], si` (`89 36 disp16`, 4
bytes). `emit_assign_global` now special-cases register-resident
int RHS to use the register-source-to-global form via the existing
`MovGroupSymReg16` instruction.

## Multi-declarator globals

`int a, b, c;` at file scope now works (fixture `478`).
`parse_global` switched from returning a single `Global` to
returning `Vec<Global>` — the comma loop mirrors the existing
local-decl multi-declarator handling. Each tail declarator
re-applies its own pointer stars and array suffix to a fresh
copy of the base type, exactly like `int *a, b;` does for
locals (fixture `174`). Per-declarator initializers
(`int a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;` — fixture `479`) and mixed forms
(`int *p, y;` — fixture `480`, `extern int e1, e2;` —
fixture `481`) all flow through the same loop.

### `&<global>` at runtime

Fixture `480` exposed two gaps:

1. **`&<global>` in runtime expression position** —
   `emit_address_of` only handled stack-resident locals. Now also
   emits `mov ax, offset DGROUP:_<g>` for globals.
2. **`<ptr-global> = &<global>;` direct immediate-store form** —
   `mov word ptr DGROUP:_p, offset DGROUP:_x` (`C7 06 <p-disp>
   <x-imm>`, 6 bytes with TWO FIXUPPs — one on each disp16). Added
   as `Instr::MovGroupSymOffsetGroupSym`; encoder reuses
   `emit_group_sym_lea` for the dst-disp FIXUPP and a new
   `emit_group_sym_imm16` helper for the src-imm FIXUPP (same
   shape, minus the opcode prefix). Without this special case the
   codegen bounces through AX (`mov ax, offset _x / mov [_p], ax`,
   5 bytes — shorter, but not what BCC emits).

### Data-extern emit order

The data-extern emit loop walks `unit.globals.iter().rev()`.
Single-extern fixtures never exposed the rule; fixture `481`
(`extern int e1, e2;`) pinned reverse-declaration order:
`extrn _e2:word` first, then `extrn _e1:word`.

### `&<arr>[K]` for global arrays

Fixture `483` exercises `p = &a[2];` where `a` is a global array.
The runtime form is parallel to `&<global>`: emit the symbol+offset
as an immediate. Two paths updated:

- `emit_expr_to_ax` for `AddressOfArrayElem`: emit
  `mov ax, offset DGROUP:_<array>[+<byte_offset>]` for global
  arrays (stack-resident locals would need LEA; no fixture yet).
- `emit_assign_global` for `<ptr-global> = &<arr>[K];`: emit
  `mov word ptr DGROUP:_<p>, offset DGROUP:_<array>[+<byte_offset>]`
  — uses the same two-FIXUPP `MovGroupSymOffsetGroupSym`
  instruction added in batch 54 (the parser's
  `parse_offset_group_symbol` already handles the `+N` suffix on
  the source symbol).

### `&<global>` as a call argument

Fixture `482` (`f(&g);`) passes through the existing call-arg
path: `emit_call` calls `emit_expr_to_ax` on the argument, which
hits the new `emit_address_of` global branch and emits
`mov ax, offset DGROUP:_<g>` before the `push ax`. No new case
needed.

### Extern array decay in expressions

Fixture `484` (`extern int a[5]; return a[0];`) passes through the
existing array-decay path. The codegen treats `a[0]` as a regular
global-array index — `mov ax, word ptr DGROUP:_a` (extern resolves
to base-of-array, offset 0). No new code; the existing
`emit_array_index_to_ax` path handles extern arrays the same as
defined ones since the address-lowering goes through the same
`<group>:_<name>+<offset>` template.

### `&<struct>.<field>` for globals

Fixture `485` exercises `p = &s.y;` where `s` is a global struct.
The parser now consumes any `.<field>[.<field>]*` chain after
`&<ident>`, threading the type table to compute the cumulative
field byte_offset and producing
`ExprKind::AddressOfArrayElem { array, byte_offset }` — the same
node shape `&<arr>[K]` produces. The existing
`MovGroupSymOffsetGroupSym` immediate-store form then emits
`mov word ptr DGROUP:_<p>, offset DGROUP:_<s>+<field-offset>`.

### `&<local-arr>[K]` — LEA from bp-offset

Fixture `486` exposed the missing local-array case in the
`AddressOfArrayElem` codegen. For stack-resident local arrays we
now emit `lea ax, word ptr [bp+off+K]` where `off` is the array's
bp-relative offset and `K` is the byte offset of the indexed
element. Encoded as `8D 46 disp8` for small offsets. The parser's
`&<ident>[K]` path was previously restricted to *global* arrays —
extended to also accept stack-resident locals by consulting
`function_locals` when `global_types` doesn't have the name.

### `typedef <type> *<name>;` — pointer typedef

Fixture `487` (`typedef int *INTP; INTP p; p = &g;`) needed the
typedef parser to consume pointer stars between the base type and
the name. Added a `while … Star` loop in `parse_typedef` matching
the existing shape in `parse_declare` and `parse_global`. The
typedef table then stores the wrapped pointer type, and uses of
`INTP` resolve to `Pointer(Int)`.

### `typedef <type> <name>[N];` — array typedef

Fixture `488` (`typedef int IARR[3]; IARR a;`) needed the
typedef parser to consume an array-suffix tail. Added the same
`while … LBracket` loop that `parse_declare` already uses,
wrapping innermost-first so a multi-dim
`typedef int M[2][3];` would yield `Array{2, Array{3, Int}}`.

### `typedef struct { … } <name>;` and typedef-of-typedef

Fixtures `489` (`typedef struct { int x; int y; } Point;`) and
`490` (`typedef int INT; typedef INT *INTP;`) both passed first
try. `parse_type` already handles inline `struct { … }` literals
and resolves a typedef-name as the referent type when it appears
where a type is expected — so a typedef whose base is another
typedef just flows through. The pointer-of-typedef in 490
exercises the right composition order at the typedef level.

### Multi-dim global arrays and nested initializers

Fixture `492` (`int a[2][3] = { {1,2,3}, {4,5,6} };`) needed two
parser extensions:

1. `parse_global` now loops the array suffix (`while LBracket`)
   instead of accepting at most one `[N]`. First suffix may still
   be `[]` for length-inference from the initializer.
2. `parse_initializer` now recurses for nested braces. Multi-dim
   array inits embed `InitList` inside `InitList`.

### Local declarations: aggregate initializer

`finish_declare` (the common tail for local Declare/static-local
hoisting) now calls `parse_initializer` instead of `parse_expr`
for the `= <init>` slot, so static locals with braced
initializers (`static int a[3] = {10, 20, 30};` — fixture `493`)
work. Scalar locals are unaffected: `parse_initializer` falls
through to `parse_expr` when no `{` is seen.

### Self-referential struct, forward struct decl, struct array field

Fixture `494` (`struct node { int value; struct node *next; };`)
needed `parse_record_type` to pre-register the tag as an empty
placeholder *before* parsing fields so that
`struct node *next` can resolve to a pointer to the in-progress
struct. The placeholder is replaced with the complete type once
all fields are parsed. The codegen for `head.next = &head;` was
unsupported (non-constant rhs panic in `emit_member_assign`);
now special-cases `&<global>` rhs to use the
`MovGroupSymOffsetGroupSym` two-FIXUPP immediate-store form.

Fixture `495` (`struct point; struct point *p; struct point
{...};`) needed a bare forward-declaration form
(`struct <tag>;`) in `parse_unit` to register the tag as an
opaque placeholder so subsequent `struct <tag> *p;` resolves.
The eventual full definition replaces the placeholder via the
same `self.structs.insert` path.

Fixture `496` (`int *f(void) { return &g; }`) needed
`parse_function` to consume pointer stars between the return
type and the function name — same shape as `parse_declare` /
`parse_global` already had. Returning `int *` from a function
flows through the existing pointer-typed return path; the
top-level type-probe already accepted the stars.

### Struct array fields, fnptr fields, struct-array-element write

Fixture `497` resolved the struct-field-of-array element write
that was deferred from an earlier batch: `struct buffer { int
len; int data[4]; }; b.data[2] = 42;`. Parser now adds `[expr]`
to `parse_atom`'s postfix loop so `b.data[2]` parses as
`ArrayIndex { array: Member { base: Ident(b), field: data },
index: 2 }`. The lvalue walker in `parse_expr_or_lvalue_assign`
detects this `ArrayIndex(Member(Ident, field), ...)` shape and
lowers it to a new `StmtKind::MemberArrayAssign { base, field,
indices, value }`. Codegen folds field-offset + Σ(idx·stride)
into a single byte displacement off the struct base and emits
one `mov word ptr DGROUP:_b+N, K` (or bp-relative for locals).
For the rvalue side (`g = b.data[2]`), `emit_array_index_to_ax`
has a similar fast-path that recognizes the same shape and emits
a single `mov ax, word ptr DGROUP:_b+N`.

The struct-fnptr field (`int (*fn)(int);` in a struct) similarly
needs new declarator support and remains deferred.

### Char array initialized to a shorter string

Fixture `498` (`char msg[16] = "hello";`) — when the declared
array length exceeds `bytes.len() + 1` (the bytes plus the NUL
terminator), the remaining slots are zero-filled out to the
declared length. `emit_global_init`'s string-literal-into-char-
array path now emits `db <byte>` lines for each character, a
trailing `db 0`, then additional `db 0` lines until the declared
length is reached. The LEDATA payload in the resulting OBJ
matches BCC byte-for-byte, including the trailing zero pad.

### `static` function definitions

Fixture `499` (`static int helper(int x) { return x + 1; } int
main(void) { return helper(41); }`) — a function with `static`
storage class is emitted in `_TEXT` like any other function
*but* never gets a `public _helper` declaration. `parse_unit` now
accepts `static` (and only `static`, not `extern`) before a
function definition, recording it on `Function::is_static`.
`emit_s.rs`'s publics loop skips static functions when building
the long/short bucket. Codegen for calls is unchanged: the call
site emits `call near ptr _helper` because TASM resolves
`_helper` within the same `_TEXT` segment without needing an
`extrn`. The `_helper` PUBDEF simply isn't emitted in the
resulting OBJ, matching BCC's output.

## Comma operator

`<expr>, <expr>` at expression level is a comma operator —
distinct from the comma as argument-list / init-list separator.
C grammar only permits it in a *comma-expression* context:
parenthesized expressions and the top of expression statements.
Implementation only handles the parenthesized form for now
(`g = (a = 1, b = 2, a + b);` — fixture `469`).

Each element inside the parens is parsed via
`parse_for_clause_expr`, which already recognizes
`<ident> = <expr>` as `ExprKind::AssignExpr`. The comma-separated
elements chain left-associatively into nested
`ExprKind::Comma { left, right }` nodes.

Codegen: the left side is discarded (side effects only) and the
right side produces the value. In `emit_expr_to_ax`, the comma
maps to `emit_expr_discard(left)` then `emit_expr_to_ax(right)`.
`emit_expr_discard` recursively handles Comma so nested chains
like `(a = 1, b = 2, a + b)` discard all but the rightmost
element correctly.

## Chained assignment

Fixture `500` (`int a, b, c; a = b = c = 5;`) — C's `=` is
right-associative and yields a value, so `a = b = c = 5` parses
as `a = (b = (c = 5))`. The statement-level dispatch for
`<ident> = …` now uses `parse_for_clause_expr` (rather than
`parse_expr`) for the RHS, so the RHS can itself be another
`AssignExpr`. `parse_for_clause_expr` was made recursive on its
RHS to support the chain.

Codegen for `AssignExpr` in value position lives in
`emit_expr_to_ax`: it recursively evaluates the inner value into
AX, then emits one `mov word ptr <target>, ax` for the
side-effect store. AX still holds the assigned value so the
outer assignment reuses it. The resulting sequence for `a = b =
c = 5;` is `mov ax, 5; mov [_c], ax; mov [_b], ax; mov [_a],
ax` — one literal load and three stores, exactly what BCC emits.

## `*p++ = v;` — store via pointer with postfix increment

Fixture `501` (`*p++ = 7; *p++ = 8;` filling a local `int[3]`)
exercises the postfix-increment pattern as an lvalue.
`emit_deref_assign` now special-cases `DerefAssign { target:
Update{p, Inc, Post}, value }`: it emits the store first (using
the pre-increment register value as the address) and then
advances the register by `sizeof(*p)` via `inc <reg>` per byte
of stride. For `int *p` in SI, the result is `mov word ptr [si],
v; inc si; inc si`. This relies on the pointer being
register-resident — no fixture exercises stack-resident `p++`
in this position yet.

## Partial array initializer

Fixture `502` (`int a[5] = {1, 2};`) — when an aggregate
initializer has fewer items than the declared array length, the
missing slots are zero-filled out to the full byte size.
`emit_global_init`'s `InitList` arm now emits `db 0` lines for
`(len - items.len()) * elem.size_bytes()` after the explicit
items. This mirrors the trailing-zero pad behavior we added for
fixed-length char-array string initializers in fixture 498.

## Pointer compared to integer constant

Fixture `504` (`int *g; if (g == 0) return 1;`) — comparing a
global pointer to a constant must use the memory-direct
`cmp word ptr DGROUP:_g, 0` form, not the load-then-compare
sequence. The `emit_compare` int-global shortcut now triggers
for any global whose type has a pointee, in addition to plain
`int`/`unsigned`. The same `83 3E disp16 ii` (imm8sx) encoding
applies; no new IR was needed.

## Forward function declaration

Fixture `506` (`int helper(int); int main(void) { return
helper(7); } int helper(int x) { return x + 1; }`) — a
function prototype followed later by the matching definition.
Two parser changes:

- `parse_param_list` now allows anonymous parameters (`int
  helper(int)` with no parameter name). When the token after a
  type is `,` or `)`, the parser synthesizes
  `__anon_param_<n>` as the name. Codegen never references these
  for a prototype-only Function (the body is `None`), so the
  synthesized name is purely a slot-filler.
- The publics ordering rule gains a third trigger: presence of
  any function prototype (`body: None`) flips the long-bucket
  emission to forward alphabetical. 506's expected output has
  `_helper, _main` (alphabetical), where 095/179 with no
  prototype use reverse.

The prototype itself is emitted as a no-op (no asm, no PUBDEF).
Only the actual definition contributes a `public _helper` line.

## `for(;;)` — empty condition

Fixture `507` (`int main(void) { int i; i = 0; for(;;) { if
(i > 5) break; i = i + 1; } return i; }`) — when the for's cond
is absent the trampoline `jmp short <check>` at loop entry is
elided. BCC layouts the body directly at the loop label and
falls through into the test/body without first jumping past the
nothing-to-check guard. `emit_for` now skips the trampoline
when `cond.is_none()`.

## Adjacent string literal concatenation

Fixture `508` (`char *s = "Hello, " "World";`) — C90 specifies
that adjacent string-literal tokens concatenate at translation
time. `parse_primary`'s StringLit arm now peeks for further
StringLit tokens, appending their bytes (and extending the
span) before returning a single `ExprKind::StringLit`. The
combined literal flows through the existing pool path, so
nothing downstream needed to change.

## Variable-indexed global int-array store

Fixture `510` (`int a[5]; for (i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) a[i] =
i;`) — when the index of a global word-element array isn't a
constant, codegen now loads it into BX (directly from a stack or
register local), shifts left by 1 for the word stride, and emits
`mov word ptr DGROUP:_a[bx], <src>` where `<src>` comes from
`resolve_operand_source(value)`. A new IR variant
`MovGroupSymBxDispReg16` encodes the `89 mod=10 reg r/m=111`
form (e.g. `89 b7 lo hi` for SI) — the immediate-source sibling
`MovGroupSymBxDispImm` was already in place for long-array
writes (fixture 305).

## `sizeof` of a string literal

Fixture `511` (`return sizeof("hi");`) — extended
`expr_static_size` to handle `ExprKind::StringLit`. The result is
`bytes.len() + 1` to include the NUL terminator. The expression
folds to an `IntLit` at parse time, just like `sizeof(<type>)`.

## Global `g++` / `g--` statement

Fixture `512` (`int g; g++; g++; return g;`) — `emit_update_in_
place` previously handled only long globals via the `add/adc 1`
pair. Plain int (and char) globals now emit the single
memory-direct `inc word ptr DGROUP:_g` (or `dec` / `byte ptr`
for char). Two new IR variants — `IncGroupSym` and `DecGroupSym`
— encode the `FF 06 lo hi` and `FF 0E lo hi` forms (Grp5 /0 INC
and /1 DEC, ModR/M r/m=110 → `[disp16]`).

## Assignment expression in `if` condition

Fixture `513` (`if ((x = 5)) return x;`) — when the condition
is `AssignExpr`, BCC evaluates the assignment (storing the value
and leaving it in AX), then emits `or ax, ax` to set the flags
for the conditional branch. `emit_zero_test` now special-cases
`ExprKind::AssignExpr`: route through `emit_expr_to_ax` (the
chain-assignment path landed in batch 61) and append the `or
ax, ax` post-test.

## Compound assigns on int global

Fixture `517` (`int g; g &= 15;`) and `519` (`g += 5;`) —
`emit_compound_assign` had no int-global path, so any `g <op>=
K` panicked on the local-only lookup. The fix added two memory-
direct emit paths against int (and uint) globals when RHS folds
to a constant:

- `BinOp::BitAnd / BitOr / BitXor` → `<and|or|xor> word ptr
  DGROUP:_g, K`. BCC always uses the imm16 form here (no
  imm8sx peephole for bitwise ops). Routes through the existing
  `AndGroupSymImm16` / `OrGroupSymImm16` / `XorGroupSymImm16`
  IR variants (originally introduced for long globals).
- `BinOp::Add / Sub` → `add|sub word ptr DGROUP:_g, K`. TASM
  picks the imm8sx form when K fits a signed byte (so `g += 5`
  encodes as `83 06 lo hi 05`, the 5-byte form) and the imm16
  form otherwise (`81 06 lo hi imm_lo imm_hi`).

## Empty statement

Fixture `522` (`for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) ;`) and `523`
(`while (g) ;`) — C90's null statement `;` was a parse error
because `parse_stmt` had no arm for bare semicolons. Added
`StmtKind::Empty` and an entry in `parse_stmt` that consumes the
single `;`. Codegen for `Empty` produces nothing (the loop's
back-edge / condition handling still runs because they're owned
by the surrounding `emit_for` / `emit_while`, not the body).
Adding the new variant required no-op arms in every match on
`StmtKind` (locals.rs use-counts, plan.rs label planner, emit_
s.rs call walker, codegen/mod.rs emit_stmt) — same pattern as
when `Goto`/`Label` were introduced.

## Char local compared to constant

Fixture `524` (`char c; c = 'A'; if (c == 'B') ...`) — the
stack-local compare path in `emit_compare` always emitted `cmp
word ptr [bp-N], K`, but for a char local BCC uses the byte
form `cmp byte ptr [bp-N], K` (encoded `80 7E disp8 imm8`). The
fix: check `ty.is_char_like()` on the named local and emit the
byte form. A new IR variant `CmpByteBpRelImm8` encodes it.
Parser handles `cmp byte ptr [bp+N], imm8` via the existing
`parse_byte_bp_relative` helper.

## Negative case label

Fixture `525` (`switch (x) { case -1: return 10; ... }`) —
`parse_switch`'s case head only accepted `IntLit` directly. It
now allows an optional leading `Minus` token and negates the
literal via `wrapping_neg` so the case value stays a u32 with
the same wrap-around semantics that `try_const_eval` produces
for `-1`. Codegen needed no change — switch comparison already
handles arbitrary u32 case values.

While integrating this, found a bug in `emit_assign_local`'s
stack-int immediate store: `try_const_eval` returns u32, so
`x = -1` was emitting `mov word ptr [bp-2], 4294967295`. Now
the path masks to `v & 0xFFFF` before formatting (matching the
already-correct char form). All prior fixtures still hit the
same byte output because their constants fit in 16 bits without
sign-extension; only the negative-literal path tripped this.

## Switch on a char scrutinee

Fixture `527` (`char c; c = 'B'; switch (c) { case 'A': ... }`)
— `emit_switch_chained`'s scrutinee load asserted Int locals
only. Char locals now load via `mov al, byte ptr [bp-N]; cbw`
(or `mov ah, 0` for uchar via `emit_widen_al`), promoting the
byte to AX before the chained `cmp ax, K / je` sequence. Case
values are 16-bit constants regardless of scrutinee type — BCC
uses `cmp ax, 0x42` even though the live value only occupies
AL.

## Char compound assign on a byte-register local

Fixture `529` (`char c; c = 'A'; c += 2;`) — `emit_compound_
assign` asserted out for byte-register dests. Added an AL-
round-trip path for `Add/Sub/BitAnd/BitOr/BitXor` with a
constant RHS:

```
mov al, <reg>
<op> al, K
mov <reg>, al
```

This required five new AL-specific tasm IR variants (`AddAlImm8`,
`SubAlImm8`, `AndAlImm8`, `OrAlImm8`, `XorAlImm8`) for the
2-byte accumulator forms (`04 ii`, `2C ii`, `24 ii`, `0C ii`,
`34 ii`). BCC always picks the AL accumulator form when AL is
the destination; the generic `80 C0+rc ii` 3-byte encoding
appears only for non-AL byte registers, which we haven't
fixtured yet.

## `y = ++x;` direct-stack-store peephole

Fixture `530` (`int x; int y; x = 5; y = ++x;`) — BCC fuses the
pre-increment with the subsequent stack store, skipping the AX
round-trip when the source is a register-resident local and the
dest is a stack slot. `emit_assign_local`'s Stack branch now
detects `Update { target, op, position: Pre }` against a
non-byte reg-local and emits `<inc|dec> <reg>; mov word ptr
[bp-N], <reg>` directly (4 bytes instead of 5 — saves the
`mov ax, <reg>` step). Post-update keeps the round-trip because
the expression value is the *old* register contents.

## Local shadowing a global

Fixture `532` (`int a; int main() { int a; a = 7; return a; }`)
— C90 scoping says the local `a` hides the global `a` inside
the function body. Codegen's ident resolution was global-first,
so writes went to the global slot and reads via `a1 lo hi`
(`mov ax, [_a]`). Both paths (`StmtKind::Assign` dispatch and
`ExprKind::Ident` in `emit_expr_to_ax`) now check `locals.has`
before the global table, falling through to the local lookup
when the name is in scope. Other codegen sites that check
`globals.contains` only matter when the local doesn't exist, so
no further changes were needed for this fixture — but the pattern
will likely need extending if more shadowing cases appear.

## NULL pointer init

Fixture `533` (`int *g = 0;`) — global pointer initialized to a
null integer constant. The existing scalar-global-init path
handles this directly: codegen emits `dw 0` for the 2-byte
slot. No special-case needed because pointer types have the same
2-byte width as int.

## `return x++;`

Fixture `534` (`int x; x = 5; return x++;`) — worked on the
first try. The existing `emit_update_to_ax` already emits the
post-increment sequence `mov ax, <reg>; inc <reg>` and the
return path loads AX, which is exactly what BCC produces.

## Char shift compound

Fixture `535` (`char c; c = 4; c <<= 2;`) — BCC unrolls a char
compound shift by a small constant K into K single-bit shifts
directly on the byte register (`shl dl, 1; shl dl, 1`) rather
than the AL round-trip used for add/sub/bitwise (fixture 529).
The 8086 has no `r/m8, imm8` shift, only `r/m8, 1` and `r/m8,
cl`, so unrolling beats the 3-byte CL setup for small K.
`emit_compound_assign`'s byte-register path now handles
`BinOp::Shl/Shr` by emitting K `<shl|sar|shr> <reg>, 1`
instructions. Three new tasm IR variants (`ShlReg8One`,
`SarReg8One`, `ShrReg8One`) encode `D0 /4|/7|/5 r/m=<reg>` for
the byte form (sibling of `ShlReg16One`'s 16-bit form). Signed
char's `>>=` lowers to `sar` (sign-fill); uchar would lower to
`shr` (zero-fill — not yet fixtured at the byte width).

### Publics-ordering rule — still partial

While probing this batch, fixture `int echo(char c) { return c; }
int main { return echo('Z'); }` (originally proposed as 535)
revealed that the long-bucket forward/reverse rule has another
hidden dimension I can't yet characterize. Probing 0..10
parameter counts and different helper names shows BCC flips
between forward and reverse seemingly based on the helper's
name (`add` reverse, `helper` forward, `abc` forward, `addy`
reverse) regardless of param count. This suggests an internal
hash-bucket discriminator inside BCC's symbol table that we
can't replicate without more reversing work. The original 535
probe was replaced with a single-function fixture to sidestep
the issue.

## `if (!x)` logical-not condition

Fixture `536` (`int g; if (!g) return 1;`) — `!x` in a
condition context lowers to the same flag-setting test as
`x`, but the conditional jump's polarity flips. `emit_cond_
test` now special-cases `Unary { op: Not, operand }` by
recursing on `operand` and swapping the returned `(true_mnem,
false_mnem)` tuple. Nested `!!x` collapses correctly through
the recursion. The actual asm output is exactly what the
unnegated test produces — only the JE/JNE pairing on the
caller side differs.

## Int local compound shift

Fixture `537` (`int x; x = 1; x <<= 4;`) — register-resident
int local compound shift. `emit_compound_assign`'s register-
local branch now handles `BinOp::Shl`/`Shr` by emitting `mov
cl, K; <shl|sar|shr> <reg>, cl`. Three new tasm IR variants
(`ShlReg16Cl`, `SarReg16Cl`, `ShrReg16Cl`) generalize the
existing `ShlAxCl`/`SarAxCl`/`ShrAxCl` to any 16-bit register.
Signed `>>=` lowers to `sar` (sign-fill); unsigned `>>=` to
`shr`. BCC always uses the CL form here even for K=1 — no
unrolled `<reg>,1` peephole at this slot, unlike the byte-
register char path (fixture 535).

## Int global compound shift

Fixture `539` (`int g; g = 80; g >>= 2;`) — int (or uint) global
compound shift by a small constant K unrolls into K memory-
direct shift-by-1 instructions, just like the byte-register
char path (fixture 535) but with a `<group>:<sym>` memory
operand. Three new tasm IR variants (`ShlGroupSymOne`,
`SarGroupSymOne`, `ShrGroupSymOne`) encode `D1 26 | 3E | 2E lo
hi`. The codegen path picks `shl` for `<<=`, `sar` for signed
`>>=`, and `shr` for unsigned `>>=`. The unrolled emit slots in
before the existing add/sub and bitwise int-global compound
paths.

## Pointer compound add/sub — stride scaling

Fixture `542` (`int *p; p = a; p += 2;`) — pointer arithmetic in
compound form scales the RHS by `sizeof(pointee)`. `emit_
compound_assign`'s register-local Add/Sub path now multiplies
the const RHS by the pointee's `size_bytes()` before emitting
`add <reg>, scaled`. For `int *p` (stride 2), `p += 2` lowers
to `add si, 4`. The K==1 → `inc` peephole is now checked against
the *scaled* value, so it only fires when the actual byte
delta is 1 (i.e. char pointer with K==1).

## Switch on a non-ident scrutinee

Fixture `544` (`switch (x + 1) { case 1: ... }`) — when the
scrutinee isn't a bare ident, `emit_switch_chained` now routes
through `emit_expr_to_ax` and lets the result land in AX
directly. The chained-cmp+je sequence after the load is
unchanged. Ident scrutinees still hit the bespoke
char-widen/global-load shortcuts.

## `c = a % b;` — store DX directly

Fixture `546` (`int a, b, c; ... c = a % b;`) — after `idiv`,
the remainder lives in DX. The generic arith-to-AX path tacks
on a `mov ax, dx` so callers can find the result in AX, but
when the destination is a memory slot we can `mov [c], dx`
directly and save 2 bytes. `emit_assign_local`'s stack-int
branch now special-cases `BinOp::Mod` to emit `cwd; idiv <b>;
mov [bp-N], dx` via a small helper `emit_arith_setup_for_mod`.

## `++a[K]` peephole

Fixture `547` (`int a[3]; ... ++a[1];`) — `emit_array_compound_
assign` now folds K=1 add/sub into a single `inc|dec <width>
ptr [bp-N]` instruction (1 byte saved vs. `add mem, 1`). A new
tasm IR variant `IncBpRel` / `DecBpRel` encodes `FF 46|4E dd`
(Grp5 /0 or /1 with mod=01 r/m=110 → `[bp]+disp8`). The same
peephole was already in place for register-resident bare-ident
locals; this extends it to memory-direct stack array elements.

## Free passes (no code changes needed)

Three more probes hit existing paths byte-exactly:

- `548` — int local compound mul `x *= 3;` — already routed
  through the imul-via-AX skeleton.
- `549` — `if (x == g)` (int local vs int global) — the generic
  `emit_compare` Ident-load + memory-source path handles the
  asymmetric operand types.
- `550` — global int initialized to a folded constant expression
  `int g = 2 + 3 * 4;` — `try_const_eval` already folds nested
  BinOps at parse time, so the slot emits `dw 14` directly.

## `void` as a return type

Fixture `552` (`static void set(int *p) { *p = 99; }`) — parser
now accepts `void` as a return type. There's no dedicated
`Type::Void`; codegen treats functions with no `return <expr>`
statements identically regardless of declared return type, so
`Type::Int` serves as a placeholder. `parse_type` matches
`KwVoid` and the top-level type-probe in `parse_unit` includes
it.

While probing this, the publics-ordering rule revealed another
dimension: `void f(int *p)` + `int main(void)` (no statics)
emits `_main, _set` (forward), not the `_set, _main` reverse
that `int f(int *p)` would produce. Tested with many helper
names and the result depends on the helper's name in some hash-
bucket way we still can't characterize. Worked around by making
the helper `static` (which skips the PUBDEF emission entirely
and sidesteps the ordering question).

## `cmp ax, 0` → `or ax, ax` peephole

Fixture `555` (`while ((c = g) > 0) ...`) — when the right
operand of a compare folds to 0 and the left has just been
loaded into AX, BCC emits the 2-byte `or ax, ax` instead of the
3-byte `cmp ax, 0`. Both set ZF/SF identically so the
subsequent conditional jump works the same. Added at the tail
of `emit_compare` (after all global/local fast paths).

## Char compound: bitwise direct, arith via AL

Fixture `556` (`char c; c &= 31;` with c in DL) revealed that
BCC takes a different path for char compound based on the op
family:

- **Add/Sub**: route through AL — `mov al, <reg>; <add|sub> al,
  K; mov <reg>, al`. AL has 2-byte accumulator forms (`04/2C
  ii`) which beat the generic 3-byte form, so the round-trip
  pays off after `inc/dec` peepholes are applied. K=1 now
  collapses to `inc al`/`dec al` (fixture 553's int sibling
  pattern, here in 8-bit form).
- **And/Or/Xor**: emit `<and|or|xor> <reg>, K` directly with no
  AL detour (3 bytes total). Bitwise ops don't get the AL-
  accumulator advantage at K width 8, so the direct form wins.

Three new tasm IR variants — `AndReg8Imm8`, `OrReg8Imm8`,
`XorReg8Imm8` — encode `80 /4|/1|/6 mod=11 r/m=<reg> imm8`.
The AL-specific 2-byte forms (`AndAlImm8` etc.) stay for AL.

## `continue;` inside a for-loop — separate slot

Fixture `558` (`for (i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) { if (i == 2)
continue; s = s + i; }`) — the label planner reserved
`continue_target_slot` only when the body had *no* nested
labels (the "filler-slot" case for fixtures like 061). When the
body had nested labels (the `if` in 558 reserves two), the
planner re-used the next slot as both the continue-target *and*
the check-slot, so the emitter dropped two identical
`@1@N:` lines and `continue;` jumped to whichever the assembler
resolved first.

The fix: planner now runs a `body_has_continue` probe alongside
the body planning. When continue is present, it reserves a
distinct continue-target slot regardless of nesting. When
continue is absent and the body added no labels, it keeps the
historical filler reservation so the downstream label numbers
match the existing for-loop fixtures byte-for-byte. The
`body_has_continue` helper is duplicated into `plan.rs` (it
already lives in `codegen/mod.rs`); they walk the same Stmt
shape and need to agree.

## Global array decay → global pointer

Fixture `561` (`int a[3]; int *p; p = a;`) — array-to-pointer
decay at the assign site between two globals. `emit_assign_
global` now special-cases `Ident(src)` where `src` is a global
array, emitting the same `mov word ptr [_p], offset _a` form
(two-FIXUPP `MovGroupSymOffsetGroupSym`) we already used for
`p = &g;`. Without this, codegen mistakenly loaded the first
word at `_a` as if it were a value.

## Pointer global `++p` — stride

Same fixture: `++p` on a global pointer scales by
`sizeof(pointee)` instead of using `inc word ptr [_p]`. `emit_
update_in_place` now checks for pointer globals: if the stride
is ≠ 1 it emits `add|sub word ptr [_p], <stride>`. Char-pointer
globals (stride 1) still use the `inc/dec` peephole.

## Char return + caller-side widen

Fixture `562` (`char get(void) { return 'Z'; } int main { int
x = get(); }`):

- **Callee**: `emit_return_value_load` now detects char return
  type with a constant value and emits `mov al, K` (2 bytes)
  instead of `mov ax, K` (3 bytes). AH is undefined per BCC's
  char-return ABI.
- **Caller**: `ExprKind::Call` in `emit_expr_to_ax` consults
  `signatures.ret_ty_of(name)` and emits `cbw` (signed char) or
  `mov ah, 0` (uchar) after the call, widening AL into AX
  before downstream consumers (assignment, arithmetic) read
  the full int.

The two halves compose: the call site doesn't need to know how
the callee left AL — `signatures` provides the return type and
the widen step always fires.

## Compare with negative literal

Fixture `563` (`int x; if (x < -5) ...`) — two layered fixes:

- `emit_compare`'s stack-local and global-const paths masked
  the const to u32 width when formatting (`{rhs}`), so `-5`
  ended up as `4294967291` in the asm text. Both now mask to
  `& 0xFFFF` before emitting.
- TASM's `parse_imm8_signed` rejected u16 values in the upper
  half (32768..65535) even when they reinterpret as a fitting
  i8. The helper now reinterprets such values as `as i16` and
  retries the i8 fit, so `cmp word ptr [bp-2], 65531` correctly
  picks the imm8sx form (`83 7E dd FB`) BCC emits for `cmp ...,
  -5`. The wide-immediate sibling `CmpBpRelImm16` (`81 7E dd lo
  hi`) was added for true imm16 constants that don't fit i8sx.

## Pointer compound subtract

Fixture `564` (`int *p; p = a; p += 4; p -= 2;`) — `sub <reg16>,
imm` had no parser/encoder route in tasm. Added `SubReg16Imm8Sx`
(`83 E(reg) ii`, 3 bytes) and `SubReg16Imm16` (`81 E(reg) lo
hi`, 4 bytes). The codegen pointer-stride scaling from fixture
542 already does the multiply (`p -= 2;` on `int *` → 2*2 = 4)
— this batch just made TASM accept the emitted asm.

## `char c = a[K];` — skip widening peephole

Fixture `567` (`char a[3] = {'x', 'y', 'z'}; char c = a[1];`) —
`emit_array_index_to_ax` for a char global array loads `mov al,
byte ptr [_a+K]` and then sign-extends with `cbw`. When the
destination is itself a char slot (byte store truncates back),
the `cbw` is purely wasted — BCC skips it.

`emit_assign_local`'s stack branch now special-cases this
shape: char-local target + char-array constant-index source on
a global. It emits `mov al, byte ptr DGROUP:_a+K; mov byte ptr
[bp-N], al` — 6 bytes — without the cbw. Other code paths
through `emit_expr_to_ax` still widen because their consumers
(arithmetic, ax-passing) need a full int.

## `if (g & K)` bit test

Fixture `569` (`int g; if (g & 1) ...`) — BCC uses the `test`
instruction to set ZF directly from a masked memory read,
avoiding the load-into-register-then-`and`-then-test path.
`emit_cond_test` now special-cases `BinOp::BitAnd` with an int
global LHS and a constant RHS: emit `test word ptr DGROUP:_g,
K` (`F7 06 lo hi imm_lo imm_hi`, 6 bytes), then the standard
`jne/je` pair. A new tasm IR variant `TestGroupSymImm16`
encodes it.

## `a += b;` between two int globals

Fixture `571` (`int a; int b; a += b;`) — `emit_compound_
assign` now handles the int-global + int-global case with `mov
ax, [_b]; add word ptr [_a], ax`. The store-back uses the
generic Grp1 r/m16, r16 form (`01 06 lo hi` for ADD; `29 06 lo
hi` for SUB). Two new tasm IR variants `AddGroupSymReg16` /
`SubGroupSymReg16` encode these.

### Char-local array layout (resolved in batch 86)

Probed `char a[3]; char c; c = a[1];` and discovered BCC's
local frame allocator pads char arrays to even byte boundaries,
leaving the byte after the array as padding. Probe was replaced
with the int-array variant (fixture 570) and the underlying
padding rule was reverse-engineered when fixture 577 surfaced
the same issue — see `char s[3]; char *p; ...` below.

## Free passes (no code changes needed)

Three more probes hit existing paths byte-exactly:

- `572` — `if (a || b)` between two int globals: the bare-ident
  short-circuit lowering already routed through `emit_cond_
  branch` and the established or-skeleton.
- `573` — `sizeof(int *)` returns 2: the parse-time
  `parse_type_name` already handles the `int *` declarator and
  `Type::Pointer(_).size_bytes()` is 2.
- `574` — `continue` inside a `while`: the planner's
  `continue_target_slot = check_slot` mapping for while was
  already correct (continue → top of test). Distinct from the
  for-loop case fixed in fixture 558.

## `char s[3]; char *p; p = s; p++; return *p;`

Fixture `577` (char pointer increment over a local char array)
forced the char-local-array layout question that was deferred
after fixture 570. Diff showed `83 ec 04` (our `sub sp, 4`) vs
BCC's `83 ec 06`: BCC rounds each array slot up to an even
number of bytes regardless of element alignment, so `char s[3]`
takes a 4-byte slot with `s[0]..s[2]` at `bp-4..bp-2` and `bp-1`
left as padding. Fixed in `crates/bcc/src/codegen/locals.rs`
by bumping `slot_size` by 1 when the type is `Array { .. }` and
`slot_size % 2 == 1`. Retroactively resolves the deferred char-
local-array layout note.

## Free passes (batch 86)

Two more probes hit existing paths byte-exactly:

- `575` — `int g = 42; int x = g;` local init from a global: the
  initializer path already routes through `emit_assign` and the
  global-load codegen.
- `576` — `r = (a == b);` comparison-as-value: `emit_eq` already
  materializes the boolean into a register and the store path
  was unchanged.

## Free passes (batch 87)

Three more probes hit existing paths byte-exactly with no code
changes:

- `578` — `if (a <= b) return 1; return 0;` (int signed less-
  than-or-equal in if-cond): `emit_cond_branch` already lowers
  `<=` to `cmp; jg <else>` with the correct signed predicate.
- `579` — `return a >= b;` (int signed greater-than-or-equal as
  return value): `emit_ge` materializes the boolean into AX and
  the return path was unchanged.
- `580` — `int f(int a, int b) { return a + b; }` (two-int-arg
  callee + call from `main`): the cdecl call/return path
  already pushes args right-to-left and the two-arg parameter
  frame layout came out byte-exact (we'd previously tested 1-
  and 3-arg variants but not 2).

## Free passes (batch 88)

Three more probes hit existing paths byte-exactly with no code
changes:

- `581` — `if (a && b)` (bare-ident logical-and between two int
  globals): the and-skeleton (`emit_cond_branch` + cascading
  branch on zero) handles this just like the bare-ident or-form
  fixed in fixture 572.
- `582` — `g--;` (int global postdec used as statement): the
  postdec lowering already maps to `dec word ptr [_g]` for the
  statement context.
- `583` — `if (!(a < b))` (logical-not applied to a relational
  expression): `emit_cond_branch` already inverts the
  predicate, so `!(a < b)` lowers to `cmp; jl <then>` (the not-
  taken edge falls through to the else).

## `int x /= K;` / `int x %= K;` on register-resident locals

Fixtures `584` (`x /= 2`) and `585` (`x %= 5`) — `emit_compound_
assign_reg` previously panicked for `Div`/`Mod`. The pattern
BCC uses for an int-register local x in SI is:

```text
  mov bx, K       ; divisor (DX is clobbered by `cwd`)
  mov ax, si      ; dividend
  cwd             ; sign-extend AX into DX:AX
  idiv bx         ; AX=quotient, DX=remainder
  mov si, ax      ; for /= ; or  mov si, dx  for %=
```

The new arm in `emit_compound_assign_reg` materializes the RHS
into BX (constant or register-source), runs the `mov ax/cwd/idiv`
prefix, and stores AX (for `/=`) or DX (for `%=`) back to the
target register. A new tasm IR variant `IdivReg16` encodes `idiv
<reg>` as `F7 (mod=11 /7 r/m=reg)`; previously only the bp-
relative form was supported.

## Free passes (batch 89)

- `586` — `char a; char b; a=1; b=2; return a + b;` (char + char
  return): the char-add lowering through AL/AH widening already
  handled this; both chars promote to int per C90, the sum lands
  in AX, and `ret` returns it.

## `f(a[K])` — direct `push word ptr [bp-N]` arg

Fixture `589` (`int f(int x); int a[3]; f(a[1]);`) — the int-
arg push path was emitting `mov ax, word ptr [bp-N]; push ax`
(4 bytes) while BCC emits `push word ptr [bp-N]` (3 bytes)
directly for memory-operand args. Added `try_direct_arg_push`
to `emit_call`: when the arg is a const-index array element on
a stack-resident int/ptr array, skip the AX round-trip and emit
the `push m16` form. The broader cases (bare ident local, bare
ident global) also use this shape in BCC but aren't currently
exercised by any fixture; the peephole was kept narrow to avoid
churning unrelated callers.

## Free passes (batch 90)

Two more probes hit existing paths byte-exactly:

- `587` — descending `for (i = 10; i > 0; i--)`: the for-loop
  planner already handles the postdec step and `i > 0` test
  shape.
- `588` — `int a; int b; ... return a > b ? a : b;` (ternary
  over int globals): `emit_ternary` materializes both branches'
  values into AX correctly.

## `int *p; p[K] = v;` — register-pointer indexed write

Fixture `590` (`int g; int *p; p = &g; p[0] = 42;`) — the
pointer-subscript-write path in `emit_array_assign` previously
only handled long pointees, falling through to the generic
"array should be stack-resident" panic for int pointers.
Extended the path: when the pointee fits in a word, emit `mov
<width> ptr [<reg>(+<off>)], <value>` directly. For `byte_off
==0` the address is `[<reg>]`; otherwise `[<reg>+<off>]`. The
non-constant RHS case still panics with an explicit "no fixture"
marker.

## `if (f())` — call as boolean condition

Fixture `591` — `emit_zero_test` previously only handled `Ident`
and `AssignExpr`. Added a `Call` arm that lowers to `call near
ptr _f; or ax, ax`, matching BCC's pattern (the call leaves the
return value in AX and `or` sets ZF for the conditional branch).

## `*K` peephole — `shl ax, 1` for power-of-2 K

Fixture `592` (`int f(int x) { return x * 2; } int main(void) {
return f(g(3)); }`) — `emit_op_with_source` for `BinOp::Mul`
previously panicked for any immediate. BCC's pattern for `* K`
with K a small power of two is to unroll into `shl ax, 1`
repeated (no `imul` involved). Added that peephole; non-power-
of-2 immediates still panic with an explicit "no fixture"
marker (BCC's shape in that case is `mov dx, K; imul dx`).

## `n + sum(n - 1)` — RHS-call evaluation order

Fixture `593` (simple recursion `int sum(int n) { if (n <= 0)
return 0; return n + sum(n - 1); }`) — `emit_expr_to_ax` for
binary ops previously always evaluated LHS into AX first. BCC's
pattern when the RHS is a call is right-first:

```text
  mov ax, si      ; (compute call arg from LHS-shared reg)
  dec ax
  push ax
  call near ptr _sum
  pop cx
  push ax         ; save call result
  mov ax, si      ; reload LHS
  pop dx          ; restore saved result
  add ax, dx
```

A call clobbers AX, so evaluating it first and saving the
result before re-loading LHS avoids the extra `push/pop` of an
already-in-AX value. Added the RHS-call branch to the BinOp arm
of `emit_expr_to_ax`: when `right.kind` is `Call`, emit RHS to
AX, push, emit LHS to AX, pop into DX, then apply the op with
DX as the source operand.

## `*p = v` — non-constant RHS for int/char pointees

Fixture `595` (`int x; int *p; p = &x; *p = *p + 1;`) — the
`*p = v` path on a register-resident pointer previously
required a constant RHS. Extended the path: when the RHS isn't
const-foldable, `emit_expr_to_ax(value)` materializes the
value in AX/AL, then `mov <width> ptr [<reg>], ax/al` stores
it. A new tasm IR variant `MovSiPtrReg16` encodes `mov word
ptr [si], <reg16>` as `89 (mod=00 reg=<src> r/m=100)`; only
the immediate form was previously supported.

## Free passes (batch 92)

- `594` — `int x; int y; x = 16; y = 2; return x >> y;`
  (signed `int >> int` with a non-constant shift count): the
  existing shift-by-CL lowering (`mov cl, byte ptr [y]; sar ax,
  cl`) already byte-matches BCC.

## Free passes (batch 93)

Three more probes hit existing paths byte-exactly with no code
changes:

- `596` — `int *p; p = &g; return p[0];` (int-pointer subscript
  read, K=0): the deref-through-register read path already
  emits `mov ax, word ptr [si]`, identical to `*p` since K=0.
- `597` — `int f(int *p) { return *p; } int main(void) { int x;
  x = 7; return f(&x); }` (passing `&local` as an int-pointer
  arg): `&x` forces `x` to a stack slot, `lea ax, word ptr [bp-
  N]` materializes the address, and the existing call path
  pushes it.
- `598` — `int main(void) { int x; x = 5; return x * x; }`
  (square of a local): the `imul <src>` path with a non-
  immediate source already handles this (both operands resolve
  to the same register-resident local — `mov ax, si; imul si`).

## `while (1)` — frame-less infinite loop

Fixture `599` (`while (1) { if (g >= 3) break; g++; }`) — when
the while condition is a const non-zero, BCC elides both the
trampoline jump and the check label, leaving just `body_label /
body / jmp body_label`. Added a constant-cond branch at the
top of `emit_while`: when `try_const_eval(cond)` is `Some(v)`
with `v != 0`, emit the body with `continue_target = body_slot`
and a trailing `jmp body_slot`. The break-target label is still
gated on `body_has_break`.

## `<stack-local> = &<global>;` — direct-store peephole

Fixture `601` (`int *p; int *q; p = &g; q = &g;`) — BCC stores
the symbol's offset directly into the stack slot with `C7 46 dd
lo hi` + FIXUPP, saving the AX round-trip used for runtime
addresses. Added the peephole in `emit_assign_local`: when the
RHS is `AddressOf(global_sym)` and the destination is a non-
char stack slot, emit `mov word ptr [bp+off], offset DGROUP:_sym`.
A new tasm IR variant `MovBpRelOffsetGroupSym` encodes that
shape (sibling of `MovGroupSymOffsetGroupSym` used by global-
to-global address writes).

## Free passes (batch 94)

- `600` — `int a, b, c; a = 1; b = 2; c = 3; return a + b + c;`
  (multi-decl int locals on one line): the parser already
  handles comma-separated declarators in a single decl, and the
  locals planner allocates each in declaration order.

## Free passes (batch 95)

Three more probes hit existing paths byte-exactly with no code
changes:

- `602` — `return (a + b) * 2;` (parenthesized sum then `* 2`):
  the runtime sum lands in AX via `add ax, <src>` and the new
  `* 2` peephole from batch 91 turns the constant multiply
  into `shl ax, 1`.
- `603` — `int a; a = 5; ++a; ++a; return a;` (sequential
  preincs on the same local): each `++a;` lowers to a register
  `inc` independently.
- `604` — `char c; int n; c = 5; n = c; return n;` (int =
  char widening through assignment): `emit_assign_local`
  already loads the char with sign extension via `cbw` and
  stores the widened word.

## Free passes (batch 96)

Three more probes hit existing paths byte-exactly with no code
changes:

- `605` — `int x; int y; x = 12; y = 10; return x | y;` (int
  OR between two locals): the bitwise-op path already emits
  `mov ax, <left>; or ax, <right>` for int operands.
- `606` — `void f(void) { return; } int main(void) { f(); return
  0; }` (void function with bare return): the void-return path
  already drops the value-load and just emits the exit jump.
- `607` — `int f(char c) { return c + 1; } int main(void) {
  return f(5); }` (int return from `char + 1` arithmetic): the
  char-param load through DL/CBW widens to AX, then `inc ax`
  computes the int return value.

### Deferred from batch 96

Probed `char f(int x) { return x + 1; }` (a char-returning
function whose body computes `x + 1` from an int param). BCC
truncates the int param at the load — `mov al, byte ptr [bp+4];
inc al` — instead of `mov ax, [bp+4]; inc ax`. Both produce
the same low byte, but BCC's shape is 1 byte longer (`inc al`
is 2 bytes vs `inc ax`'s 1) and matches the function's char
return type. Implementing this would require routing char-
returning function bodies through AL where the source is a
narrow expression. Probe replaced with the `int f(char c)`
direction (mirror image) — that one works through existing
char-param widening.

## `c & K` — `and ax, imm16` accumulator form

Fixture `609` (`char c; c = 15; return c & 4;`) — after `mov
al, byte ptr [bp-1]; cbw`, BCC emits `25 04 00` (`and ax,
imm16`, the AX-specific accumulator form). Our tasm parser
previously accepted only `and ax, <symbol-or-mem>` forms. Added
the `AndAxImm16` IR variant with encoding `25 lo hi` plus a
parser entry that fires when LHS is AX and RHS is a 16-bit
immediate. 3 bytes vs the 4-byte generic `81 E0 lo hi`.

## Free passes (batch 97)

- `608` — `for (i = 0; i <= 5; i++) sum = sum + i;` (`<=` in
  for-test): the for-loop check lowers `<=` to `cmp; jg
  <break>` correctly.
- `610` — `char c; char *p; p = &c; return *p;` (char pointer
  to a stack char-local): `&c` forces `c` to a stack slot,
  `lea ax, [bp-1]` materializes the address, and `mov al,
  byte ptr [si]` reads through the pointer.

## `x | K` / `x ^ K` — `or/xor ax, imm16` accumulator forms

Fixtures `611` (`return x | 8;`) and `612` (`return x ^ 3;`) —
mirrors of the batch-97 `and ax, imm16` fix. BCC uses the AX-
specific 3-byte accumulator forms: `0D lo hi` for OR and `35
lo hi` for XOR. Added `OrAxImm16` and `XorAxImm16` IR variants
with their parser entries.

## `x % K` / `x / K` — materialize divisor in BX

Fixture `613` (`return x % 7;`) — the `idiv` instruction has
no immediate form. BCC materializes the divisor in BX with
`mov bx, K`, then `cwd; idiv bx`. `emit_op_with_source` for
`Mod`/`Div` previously panicked on immediate sources. Added
the imm path: emit `mov bx, K; cwd; idiv bx`, then for `Mod`
append `mov ax, dx` (remainder). Symmetric with the compound
`/= K` path landed in fixture 584.

## `x * K` — non-power-of-2 path

Fixture `615` (`return x * 3;`) — the batch-91 `* K` peephole
only covered powers of two (`shl ax, 1` unrolling). For other
constants BCC materializes K in DX and uses single-operand
`imul dx`. Added the non-power-of-2 arm: `mov dx, K; imul dx`.

## Char-ident RHS — same RHS-first shape as `Call`

Fixture `616` (`int f(int a, char b) { return a + b; }`) —
loading a char clobbers AX through the `mov al, byte ptr ...;
cbw` widen, so BCC evaluates the char RHS first, pushes the
widened result, then loads the int LHS, pops into DX, and
applies the op. Previously our `emit_binary_right` had a
char-on-right pattern that produced a functionally equivalent
result through `push ax / mov al,...; cbw / mov dx, ax / pop
ax`, which is 2 bytes longer because of the extra `mov dx,
ax`. Extended the batch-92 RHS-clobbers-AX check (originally
just `Call`) to also fire on a char-typed `Ident` RHS, routing
through the cleaner `evaluate RHS / push / evaluate LHS / pop
dx / op` shape.

## Free passes (batch 99)

- `614` — `return x / 7;` (int divide by const): the batch-98
  `Div` immediate path already covers this — `mov bx, K; cwd;
  idiv bx` with no `mov ax, dx` follow-up (quotient is already
  in AX).

## `while (x--)` — postdec as boolean condition

Fixture `619` — `emit_zero_test` previously handled `Ident`,
`AssignExpr`, and `Call`. Added a `Post`-update arm that
materializes the value-then-side-effect sequence via
`emit_expr_to_ax` and follows with `or ax, ax`. BCC's shape
for `x--` in a boolean context (with `x` in SI) is `mov ax,
si; dec si; or ax, ax` — exactly what the existing postdec
lowering produces when its result is used.

## Free passes (batch 100)

- `617` — `int x; x = 0; if (!x) return 1; return 0;` (`!x`
  on an int local in if-cond): `emit_cond_branch` already
  inverts the test through the standard `or ax, ax; je
  <then>` shape.
- `618` — `int x; int r; x = 0; r = !x; return r;` (`!x` as
  a value): `emit_logical_not` materializes `1` or `0` into
  AX based on the operand's zero-test.

## Chained `&&` / `||` — non-final operand short-circuit

Fixtures `620` (`if (a && b && c)`) and `621` (`if (a || b ||
c)`) — `emit_cond_branch` previously panicked with "nested
`&&`/`||` operators not yet supported". The recursive `&&`
case already inherited `(true_slot, false_slot)` for the right
operand, so chained `&&` was already correct once the assert
was lifted. The Or case was asymmetric: it passed `(None,
false_slot)` to the right, expecting the caller to emit the
true label immediately after — that's the "right falls through
on true" optimization for flat `a || b`. For chained
`(a || b) || c` (left-associative), the inner Or's right `b`
isn't the final operand: between b's evaluation and the true
label the outer Or emits `c`'s test, so b's "fall through on
true" lands in the middle of c's test. Fixed by distinguishing
final vs non-final Or via the outer `false_slot`: when
`false_slot.is_some()` we're at the top of an if-cond chain
(right can fall through); when `false_slot.is_none()` we're
inside another Or's LHS (right must jump on true to the
inherited `true_slot`).

## Free passes (batch 101)

- `622` — `char c; c = 1; c |= 32; return c;` (char compound
  OR with constant): the existing char-register compound-
  bitwise path (`or <reg8>, K`) already handled this — sibling
  of fixture 556's `c &= 31`.

### Deferred from batch 101

Probed `int main(void) { int a[3] = {10, 20, 30}; return
a[1]; }` (int local array with initializer list). BCC stores
the initializer values in a `_DATA`-segment `d@w` block and
copies them into the stack frame at function entry via
`N_SCOPY@` (the same helper used for struct copies > 4 bytes).
Our codegen panics with "non-constant init for non-int-like
type Array { elem: Int, len: 3 }". Implementing this would
need the init-data emitter plus the prologue-time
`push ss; lea ax, [bp-N]; push ax; push ds; mov ax, offset
d@w; push ax; mov cx, <size>; call N_SCOPY@` shape — sizable.
Probe replaced with the char-compound-OR variant.

## `c -= K` — BCC normalizes as `add al, -K`

Fixture `623` (`char c; c -= 3;`) — BCC canonicalizes char
compound subtract as `add al, -K` (encoded `04 FD` for `c -=
3`) rather than `sub al, K` (`2C 03`). Both are 2 bytes and
produce the same result modulo 256, but BCC picks the `add`
form consistently. Updated the char compound `+=`/`-=` arm in
`emit_compound_assign_reg`: for `Sub` with K != 1, emit
`add al, -K` (negation taken as i8). Char compound `+=` keeps
emitting `add al, K`.

## `add ax, word ptr [di]` — second-pointer dereference

Fixture `625` (`int *p; int *q; ... return *p + *q;`) — BCC
enregisters the two pointer locals into SI and DI; the
sum lowers to `mov ax, [si]; add ax, [di]`. Our tasm
previously only had `AddAxFromSiPtr` (`03 04`). Added the DI
companion `AddAxFromDiPtr` (`03 05`, ModR/M 05 = mod=00
reg=AX r/m=101 ([DI])) and its parser entry.

## Free passes (batch 102)

- `624` — `char c; c ^= 32;` (char compound XOR with const):
  the bitwise-compound path already emits `xor <reg8>, K`
  (sibling of fixture 556's `c &= 31` and 622's `c |= 32`).

## `x >> K` / `x << K` — unroll for K ≤ 3

Fixture `627` (`return x >> 3;`) — BCC unrolls expression-
context shifts by 1, 2, or 3 into `<sar|shr|shl> ax, 1`
repeated, even when K=3 (where the unrolled 6 bytes is longer
than the CL form's 4 bytes). For K ≥ 4 BCC switches to `mov
cl, K; <op> ax, cl`. Probed K = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 to pin the
threshold. Updated the `Shl`/`Shr` arm of `emit_op_with_source`:
when the source is an immediate K in 1..=3, emit K copies of
`<op> ax, 1`; otherwise fall back to the existing CL form.
(Note: compound shifts like `x <<= 4` keep using `mov cl, K;
shl reg, cl` per fixture 537 — this asymmetry between
expression and compound context is BCC's, not ours.)

## `*p = x` — register-source direct store

Fixture `628` (`int f(int x, int *p) { *p = x; return x; }`)
— with `p` enregistered in DI and `x` in SI, BCC stores SI
directly to `[di]` via `89 35` (`mov [di], si`) — skipping the
AX round-trip our codegen had used after batch 92. Added a
peephole in the `*p = v` register-pointer path: when the RHS
is a non-char ident on a register-resident local, emit `mov
<width> ptr [<addr_reg>], <src_reg>` directly. Also added the
`MovDiPtrReg16` tasm IR variant (`89 mod=00 reg=<src> r/m=101
([DI])`) to encode it; only the SI form existed previously.

## Free passes (batch 103)

- `626` — `return x << 4;` (int shift-left by 4): falls into
  the CL form (since K=4 ≥ 4 per the new unroll cutoff above)
  — `mov cl, 4; shl ax, cl`.

## `x - K` — BCC normalizes as `add ax, -K`

Fixture `630` (`int x; x = 10; return x - 5;`) — BCC
canonicalizes int subtract-const as the AX-accumulator
`add ax, imm16` form (`05 FB FF` for `x - 5`) rather than
the `sub ax, imm8sx` form (`83 E8 05`). Both are 3 bytes
when K fits in i8, but `add ax, -K` keeps using 3 bytes for
the full 16-bit range while `sub ax, K` would grow to 4
bytes via `81 E8 lo hi` once K exceeds 127. Mirror of the
batch-102 `c -= K` → `add al, -K` fix. Updated the `Sub` arm
of `emit_op_with_source` to emit the negated-add form for
immediate sources.

## Free passes (batch 104)

- `629` — `int x; x = 13; return x & 7;` (int AND with const
  small enough to fit imm16): the `AndAxImm16` form added in
  batch 97 already handles this (`25 07 00`).
- `631` — `int a; int b; ... return (a + b) / 2;` (sum then
  divide-by-const): the runtime add lands in AX; the const
  divide goes through the batch-98 `mov bx, 2; cwd; idiv bx`
  path. (Note: BCC does NOT use a `sar` peephole for divide
  by power of 2 here — same shape as `/ 7`.)

## `int x = -K;` — mask negative initializer to width

Fixture `632` (`int x = -5; return x;`) — `try_const_eval`
returns a u32 (`-5` becomes 0xFFFFFFFB = 4294967291 decimal),
which leaked through the stack-init `mov word ptr [bp-N],
{v}` write and produced an out-of-range imm. Fixed by masking
`v & 0xFFFF` (int) or `v & 0xFF` (char) at the stack-init
emit site. The global-init path already did this; the local-
init path didn't.

## `c *= K` (power-of-2 K) — round-trip + `shl al, 1` unroll

Fixture `633` (`char c; c = 3; c *= 4;`) — char compound
multiply previously hit the "char compound on byte target not
yet supported" assert. BCC's pattern for K a small power of
two is round-trip through AL with unrolled `shl al, 1`: `mov
al, <reg>; shl al, 1; shl al, 1; mov <reg>, al`. Added that
arm to `emit_compound_assign_reg` next to the char-shift
sibling. Non-power-of-2 K still panics (BCC would presumably
use `mov dl, K; imul dl` — no fixture yet).

## Free passes (batch 105)

- `634` — `for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) { if (i > 5) break; sum +=
  i; }` (for + nested-if + break + compound-add): the existing
  for-loop body emission already routes `break` from inside a
  nested if to the loop's break_target_slot, and the compound
  `+=` path emits `add <reg>, <op>` in place.

## `while (*p)` — deref through reg-pointer as boolean

Fixture `636` (`char *p; while (*p) { n++; p++; }`) —
`emit_zero_test` panicked because the condition is `Deref(Ident
p)`, not bare `Ident`. BCC's pattern with `p` enregistered in SI
is `cmp byte ptr [si], 0; jne ...` directly (no AX round-trip).
Added a `Deref(Ident reg-pointer)` arm to `emit_zero_test` that
emits `cmp <width> ptr [<reg>], 0` with the width from the
pointee. New tasm IR variant `CmpByteSiPtrImm8` encodes the
byte form (`80 3C ii`).

## Free passes (batch 106)

- `635` — `char c = -1; return c;` (char neg-literal init):
  the batch-105 char-init mask (`v & 0xFF`) handles the
  negative value cleanly — `mov byte ptr [bp-1], 255`.
- `637` — `int x; int y; x = 5; y = x * 3; return y;` (int
  mul-const stored to local): the batch-99 `mov dx, 3; imul
  dx` path routes through AX, then `mov word ptr [bp-N], ax`
  stores the result.

## `c /= K` / `c %= K` — char compound divide/modulo

Fixture `640` (`char c; c = 12; c /= 4;`) — two related
changes:

1. **Codegen**: added the char compound div/mod arm in
   `emit_compound_assign_reg`. Pattern (BCC):
   `mov al, <reg>; cbw; mov bx, K; cwd; idiv bx; mov <reg>,
   <al|dl>`. The cbw widens char to AX, idiv produces quotient
   in AX and remainder in DX, then the low byte of the chosen
   result stores back. Shift-unroll wouldn't match signed
   semantics (rounding differs for negative values).
2. **Allocator**: BCC drops DL from the char pool when the
   function body contains any signed div/mod, because the
   `cwd` preceding `idiv` clobbers DX. Probed by comparing
   our output to BCC's — our planner had c in DL, BCC had it
   in CL. Added `body_has_div_or_mod` walk and a new
   `CHAR_POOL_DIV = [CL, BL]` variant that's selected when
   the body has division.

## Free passes (batch 107)

- `638` — `int x; x = 5; if (x != 0) return 1; return 0;`
  (int `!= 0` in if-cond): `emit_cond_branch` already emits
  `cmp ax, 0; jne ...` for the comparison-with-zero pattern.
- `639` — `int a; int b; ... if (a != b) return 1;` (int !=
  int): the standard cmp-as-branch path lowers `!=` to `cmp;
  jne` over the operand pair.

### Deferred from batch 88

- Probed `int a[5]; return sizeof(a);` (`582` first draft).
  Diff showed our prologue/epilogue still allocates the frame
  (`sub sp, 10` + `mov sp, bp`) while BCC elides both because
  the array is never referenced at runtime — only in `sizeof`,
  which is constant-folded at parse time. The fix is a frame-
  elision pass: skip the slot for any local whose only uses are
  inside `sizeof`. Probe replaced with int-global postdec until
  we have appetite to thread "live local" tracking into the
  locals planner.
- Probed `int a[5]; int i = 2; return a[i + 1];` (`583` first
  draft). Our codegen panics at `emit_array_addr_to_bx` with
  "non-ident array index not yet supported (no fixture)" — only
  bare-ident array indices route through that path; a `BinaryOp`
  index needs an `emit_expr_to_ax`/`mov bx, ax` prefix instead.
  Probe replaced with the logical-not-of-compare variant until
  the non-ident array index path lands.

## What we explicitly defer

- Templates, namespaces, RTTI, exceptions (not in BC2.0 to relevant
  extent for our fixtures).
- The full preprocessor — current fixtures avoid `#include` and macro
  expansion. When a fixture demands it, the preprocessor should be its own
  module.
- Floating-point literals, wide-char, multibyte, C++ classes, templates,
  exceptions, and full C/C++ diagnostic recovery.
- Error recovery for malformed input — we just bail. BCC's specific
  recovery behavior gets matched only if a fixture exercises it.
